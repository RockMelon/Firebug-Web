<h3>Always at your service</h3>
<p>Firebug is always just a keystroke away, but it never gets in your way. You can open Firebug in a separate window, or as a bar at the bottom of your browser. Firebug also gives you fine-grained control over which websites you want to enable it for.</p>

<h3>Inspect and edit HTML</h3>
<p>Firebug makes it simple to find HTML elements buried deep in the page. Once you've found what you're looking for, Firebug gives you a wealth of information, and lets you edit the HTML live.</p>

<h3>Tweak CSS to perfection</h3>
<p>Firebug's CSS tabs tell you everything you need to know about the styles in your web pages, and if you don't like what it's telling you, you can make changes and see them take effect instantly.</p>

<h3>Visualize CSS metrics</h3>
<p>When your CSS boxes aren't lining up correctly it can be difficult to understand why. Let Firebug be your eyes and it will measure and illustrate all the offsets, margins, borders, padding, and sizes for you.</p>

<h3>Monitor network activity</h3>
<p>Your pages are taking a long time to load, but why? Did you go crazy and write too much JavaScript? Did you forget to compress your images? Are your ad partner's servers taking a siesta? Firebug breaks it all down for you file-by-file.</p>

<h3>Debug and profile JavaScript</h3>
<p>Firebug includes a powerful JavaScript debugger that lets you pause execution at any time and have look at the state of the world. If your code is a little sluggish, use the JavaScript profiler to measure performance and find bottlenecks fast.

<h1>What is Firebug?</h1>
<p>Firebug integrates with Firefox to put a wealth of web development tools at your fingertips while you browse. You can edit, debug, and monitor CSS, HTML, and JavaScript live in any web page.</p>

<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Firebug is a web development tool that facilitates the debugging, editing, and monitoring of any website's CSS, HTML, DOM, XHR, and JavaScript; it also provides other web development tools. Firebug's JavaScript panel can log errors, profile function calls, and enable the developer to run arbitrary JavaScript. Its net panel can monitor URLs that the browser requests, such as external CSS, JavaScript, and image files. The net panel can display both request headers and response headers for each page asset; it can also estimate the time each asset took to load.</p>

<p>Firebug is free and open source; it is licensed under the BSD license. Firebug was initially written in January 2006 by Joe Hewitt, one of the original Firefox creators. The Firebug Working Group oversees the open source development and extension of Firebug. It has two major implementations: an extension (add-on) for Mozilla Firefox and a bookmarklet implementation called Firebug Lite. A cross-browser version is in development. Currently, the Firebug add-on has over 3 million active daily users.</p>

<p>In addition to debugging web pages, Firebug is a useful tool for web security testing and web page performance analysis.<br />
